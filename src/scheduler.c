 * ABI: r0..r3 are caller-saved (scratch registers), R4..R12 are callee-saved.
 * It is appropriate to use R12 for a system call opcode (saved by NVIC). The
 * stack pointer points to the current extent of the stack -- it is decremented
 * before being used as index in a store. The stack grows downwards, to lower
 * addresses. When an interrupt is processed, 8 registers are stored. LR is set
 * to a special value that makes an ordinary function return into a return from
 * interrupt. The LR value indicates which stack is going to be used (process
 * or main) and can be modified before return.
